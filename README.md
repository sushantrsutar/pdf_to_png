# pdf_to_png
the code to take an input folder containing multiple PDFs, merge them into one PDF, and then convert the merged PDF into PNG format

PDF Merger and Converter is a user-friendly desktop application designed to simplify PDF management and conversion. The application allows users to merge multiple PDF files from a selected folder into a single PDF document and then convert each page of the merged PDF into high-resolution PNG images.

The tool is perfect for anyone who needs to handle multiple PDFs efficiently, whether for professional, academic, or personal purposes. With its intuitive GUI, users can easily select input files and specify output locations, making the process seamless and straightforward.

This project leverages Python libraries like PyPDF2 for merging PDFs, PyMuPDF for converting PDFs to images, and tkinter for creating a graphical user interface.
